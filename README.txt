Cleans the copied html while pasting it to tinymce editor

== Description ==

This plugin simply removes all the classes and useless attributes in each html tag, also removes some tags which might not be needed as per my testing. Makes life a lot easier when you type content in wordpad and copy to your tinymce, or for any other reason you need to paste it there in html form!

Upload the plugin to your blog, Activate it, You're done!
